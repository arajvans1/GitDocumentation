        <h1>Git Commands</h1>
        <pre>
        repo -> repository
        clone -> bring a repo down from the internet (remote repository like Github) to your local machine
        add -> track your files and changes with Git
        commit -> save your changes into Git
        push -> push your changes to your remote repo on Github (or another website)
        pull -> pull changes down from the remote repo to your local machine
        status -> check to see which files are being tracked or need to be commited
        init -> use this command inside of your project to turn it into a Git repository and start using Git with that codebase 

        git push origin master -> to push changes to Github
        git push -u origin master -> in future we will be able to just say git push to push the 
                  changes to remote repository. -u is for upstream.
